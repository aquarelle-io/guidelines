## Git Commit Guidelines

If there is already a ticket, use this number at the start of your commit message. This is [automatically checked with Zappr](https://zappr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup/#commit-messages)!

Use [semantic commit messages](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages):

* feat (new feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (changes to documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
* refactor (refactoring production code)
* test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

**Example:** `#42 feat: This is my new feature.`
